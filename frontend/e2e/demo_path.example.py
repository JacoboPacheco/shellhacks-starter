"""
EXAMPLE of frontend/e2e/demo_path.py — the script that replays SPEC.md's demo
script and asserts what a judge sees at each step. Copy it to demo_path.py and
rewrite the steps for the real demo; scripts/check.sh runs demo_path.py on every
change once it exists.

    python frontend/e2e/demo_path.py [frontend-url]     (default http://localhost:4173)

Rules it follows: URL as argv[1]; exits non-zero on any failed step; safe against
the deployed app (it deletes what it creates); needs the demo auto-login
(VITE_DEMO_EMAIL/VITE_DEMO_PASSWORD at build time) and a seeded backend.
