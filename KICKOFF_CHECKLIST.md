# Kickoff day runbook

**ShellHacks 2026: Sept 25–27, FIU Graham Center (Modesto Maidique Campus).** Check-in Friday 3–6 pm (physical ID matching your application + the QR code from your Hacker Dashboard). **Hacking and Devpost submissions close Sunday 11:00 am ET.** Judging criteria, equally weighted: Completion, Originality, Design, Technology, Practicality. Judging is in person: a **3-minute presentation to one judge** (Round 1), then top projects get a 3–5 minute Round 2 — be at your assigned table by 1 pm. The Devpost submission needs your GitHub repo link, at least one Discord tag, the sponsor challenges you opt into, and a **required 3-minute demo video**. The Devpost page appears the day before the event — re-read its Rules tab then. Everything runs on the laptop; git push is the backup.

## Before the event (tonight, in this order — then sleep)
- [ ] **Have an idea, or plan to generate one.** If you have candidates, use the rubric below. If you have none, that's fine: at kickoff, once the sponsor challenges are pasted in, `/ideas` interviews you, generates and scores candidates against them, and helps you pick — but decide before you sleep tonight if you can, since sponsor prizes only adjust an idea, they don't replace having one. Two candidates, one sentence each, plus the one moment that makes a judge react. Score each 1–5 on: (1) a judge recognizes the problem from one sentence, (2) the wow moment is something a judge *watches happen*, not something you explain, (3) the walking skeleton — the exact demo path, ugly — is buildable in 10 hours with this stack, (4) there's one genuinely technical piece doing real work (AI, vision, real-time, data), (5) it fits a sponsor track without forcing it. Pick the higher total; a tie goes to (3). Decide tonight — the sponsor list at kickoff only adjusts it.
- [ ] Put the starter on GitHub: `gh auth login`, then `gh repo create shellhacks-starter --public --source . --push`
- [ ] On github.com → the repo → Settings → tick **Template repository**
- [ ] Dry-run the kickoff command so it's not new on the day: in `C:\dev`, `gh repo create kickoff-test --public --clone --template <your-github-user>/shellhacks-starter`, confirm `backend\.env` and `app.db` are NOT in it, then delete the test repo (`gh repo delete kickoff-test --yes`) and the folder
- [ ] Free API keys, saved where you can paste from: Gemini (aistudio.google.com/apikey — `llm.py` is wired for it; the default model is a Flash-Lite because that's the one with a usable free quota, confirm at aistudio.google.com/rate-limit), Unsplash (photos). Sponsor API keys wait until the challenges are released at kickoff
- [ ] `python -m pip install playwright` then `python -m playwright install chromium` (once, ~300MB; `python -m` so it lands in the same `python` that `check.sh` calls) — without it `.\check.ps1`'s browser check prints SKIPPED and still passes, and Claude's `webapp-testing` skill and `/pitch` screenshots use it too
- [ ] Photos: copy the repo-root `.env.example` to `.env` and paste `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`; Gemini goes in `backend\.env`
- [ ] 15 minutes: learn to open the browser console (F12 → Console and Network tabs) and paste the red text to Claude. This is the one skill that unblocks a stuck AI on a frontend bug.
- [ ] 60-minute timed mini-build from the template: `/spec` a throwaway idea, build one feature end to end (table → endpoint → page), `/check`, commit. This tests your loop, not the code. Write down where you got stuck.
- [ ] Practice deploy per DEPLOY.md, timeboxed to 45 minutes. If Render/Vercel fight you, stop and do it at hour 4 of the event instead. Delete the practice services afterwards (DEPLOY.md top note).
- [ ] Laptop settings for a 36-hour build: Settings → System → Power → "When plugged in, put my device to sleep after" → **Never** (a sleeping laptop kills the Claude session mid-turn). Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Exclusions → add `C:\dev` (otherwise Defender re-scans `node_modules` on every change and eats the disk — you hit this on `Projects` already).
- [ ] Join the ShellHacks Discord and link it to your ShellHacks account (channels are hidden until you do); non-FIU students fill in the parking portal form or get fined.
- [ ] Sleep 6+ hours. Pack: laptop, charger, phone + charger, battery bank, headphones, jacket (rooms are cold), blanket. **No extension cables or power strips — venue rule.**

## First 15 minutes
- [ ] In `C:\dev` (outside OneDrive — it's slow and locks files mid-build):
  `gh repo create <project-name> --public --clone --template <your-github-user>/shellhacks-starter`
  The project gets its own GitHub repo with event-time history only, and a "generated from" badge that discloses the template.
- [ ] Paste the sponsor challenge list (from the opening ceremony / event site) into CLAUDE.md under "Sponsor / company challenges to target" — `/spec` reads it from there
- [ ] Do the one-time setup in README.md (venv, `pip install`, `npm install`, `backend\.env` with a new `JWT_SECRET` and your `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- [ ] `.\check.ps1` → must say `ALL CHECKS PASSED` before you write a single feature — and the "browser check" section must not say "skipped" (that means Playwright is missing)
- [ ] Start Claude Code in the repo and **accept the "trust this folder" prompt** — until you do, the permission allowlist and hooks in `.claude/settings.json` are silently ignored. Also accept the prompt to install the repo's plugins (`frontend-design`, `example-skills`). If no prompt appears, `/plugin` and check they're listed.
- [ ] `/model` → pick the bigger model. No idea yet: run `/ideas` first (15 minutes) — it generates and scores candidates against the sponsor list and you pick one. Then run `/spec <your idea in a sentence>` — it interviews you, writes SPEC.md, fills in CLAUDE.md, and commits "Start ShellHacks project". (Inside the `/spec` turn Claude first asks for the kickoff and end times — have the schedule handy.) Timebox: 20 minutes; you already chose the idea.
- [ ] `/clear`, `/model` → Sonnet, then "build from SPEC.md, walking skeleton first"

## Building
- [ ] `.\dev.ps1` keeps both servers up in two windows (backend auto-reloads); leave them running all day
- [ ] Model plan: build on Sonnet. Switch up (`/model`) for hard debugging when Sonnet has failed twice, and for the final review. Switch back after.
- [ ] Walking skeleton by hour 10: the ugliest version of the exact demo path working end to end. Then iterate. Never breadth-first.
- [ ] Claude keeps CLAUDE.md's "Current status" and "Decisions" updated with each commit — glance at them when you come back from a break; they're the session's memory
- [ ] If the laptop restarts or the terminal dies: `.\dev.ps1` again, then `claude --continue` in the repo — it picks up the same session; its first move is reading Current status
- [ ] Three Claude Code moves worth knowing: a change made things worse → press **Esc twice** and rewind to before it; a side question you don't want cluttering the session → start it with `/btw`; the session feels confused after many corrections → `/clear` and restate the task (Claude reloads CLAUDE.md, SPEC.md, and Current status)
- [ ] Watch the status line at the bottom: `ctx` is how full Claude's memory is (it compacts itself near the top — fine), `5h` is your usage limit, `↑N` is unpushed commits
- [ ] Deploy early (see DEPLOY.md), by hour 4. Data lives in Render's Postgres, so redeploys don't lose anything. A broken deploy found early is a non-event; found late is a crisis.
- [ ] `git push` every couple of hours — backup if the laptop dies, and it keeps the timestamped history safe (Claude nags at 2 unpushed commits)
- [ ] Re-check Scope every few hours — cut "nice to have" the moment you're behind
- [ ] Sleep night one. Solo with no sleep produces garbage on day two.

## Last 3 hours — stop building new features
- [ ] Freeze features, fix only what's broken
- [ ] Judging is table-to-table: **demo from your laptop's localhost** (`.\dev.ps1`, `seed.py` so the demo data exists). The deployed URL is for Devpost and for judges who click later.
- [ ] Final push → Render + Vercel redeploy on their own; run `backend\venv\Scripts\python backend\smoke_test.py <render-url> <vercel-url>` once Render shows green. Demo data persists in Postgres; write the demo login on paper anyway.
- [ ] `/pitch` — 30-second version, the 3-minute presentation script, Devpost writeup, screenshots, project README. Read the presentation out loud with a timer; memorize the 30-second one.
- [ ] Record the **3-minute demo video** (required on Devpost) by one hour before the deadline: screen-record the demo path on localhost while reading the presentation script. Upload it and put the link in the submission.
- [ ] `/ship-check` — every readiness check, including the rules disclosure line, a secrets scan, and the Devpost fields (repo link, Discord tag, challenge opt-ins, video)
- [ ] Full run-through of the demo path on both localhost and the deployed URL

## Before you sleep / leave
- [ ] Confirm the deployed URL works from a phone on cellular data (not the venue wifi)
- [ ] Charge everything
